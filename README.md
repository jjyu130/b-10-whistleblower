This software allows users to submit reports for issues related to their housing.
They must first join a building group given to them by a building administrator, then they can submit reports to any group they are a part of.
The user can view previous reports and delete them if they desire. 
Administrators can create groups that users join and view the reports that the users create, as well as closing reports opened by  with a admin message.
A user can sign up as either a User or Admin, which they are prompted for the first time they create their account.
There is also another level, called SuperAdmin, which can view the reports of users from all groups.
The SuperAdmin status can only be obtained through the Django Admin page, meaning someone seeking this status should contact the Django administrators.
